My favorite work microscope - the Carl Zeiss Stemi IVb. Whether it's stones, living organisms, foodstuffs, or anything else, this microscope is perfectly suited for quickly seeing things better than the eye.

I even received this transmitted light unit, and now the rotating polar table is installed, making it an incredibly versatile device. Adjusting the magnification is easy. The incident light lamps can be adjusted very well in all directions!

In my opinion, one of the best stereo microscopes for home use.
